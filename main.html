		<p>Thad,</p>
		<p>If you are reading this, it's because you have played directly into my hands.</p>
		<p>You absolute simpleton.</p>
		<p>A crueller adversary would laced this website with a malicious trojan, ransom-ware virus, or laughing skull animation that uses your hardware to mine bit-coins. Fortunately for you, I don't know how to do any of those things, so my gift for you is indefinite safety from my websites until I learn how to make them more dangerous, at which point you will be among the first to know. Additionally, the gift that I bought you would have required a lot of wrapping paper, so it's in my car.</p>
		<p>Merry Christmas, fucker.</p>
		<p>Love,</p>
		<p>Chris, Amanda, & Cremesicle</p>
